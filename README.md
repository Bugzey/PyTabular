# PyTabular


### Download

Currently not in pypi, but feel free to take the dist file and use.

### How Does It Work?

Thanks to 'Pythonnet <https://pythonnet.github.io/>'

### Getting Started

In your python environment, import pytabular and call the main Tabular Class. Only parameter needed is a solid connection string.

```python
    import pytabular
    model = pytabular.Tabular(CONNECTION_STR)
```
